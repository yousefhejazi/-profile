Here i will show you how to check or fetch for your publicIP adresss.

to create a powershell code that retrieves our ip address we need to use a web api to make it easy, we put this command in ours windows powershell.

 curl ifconfig.me	

 if you done this correct there pops up a menu with your ip address like you can see in the readme file.
